## üß© Overview

This repository provides a clean, CMake-integrated version of the **STM32L0xx HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)** drivers officially released by STMicroelectronics.

It is designed to simplify integration into modern bare-metal embedded projects using the GCC ARM toolchain.

- ‚úÖ Compatible with `gcc-arm-none-eabi`
- üß± Modular structure (only build what you use)
- üîß Easily integrable into other STM32L0 projects
